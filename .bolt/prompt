For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, use vanilla Javascript, no framework, pure static project with HTML + CSS + JS

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

Use stock photos from unsplash where appropriate, only valid URLs you know exist. Do not download the images, only link to them in image tags.

I'd like to have a password checker with a security gauge inspired by the pcheck page attached
I'd like it portable so I can plug it in easily on simple html
like: 
```html
<h1>Password check</h1>

<input type=password>
<gauge></gauge>
<zxcvbn></zxcvbn>

<script src="gauge.js"></script>
``
